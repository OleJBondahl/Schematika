# Ratchet suppressions

Suppressions added during quality ratchet waves. Each entry includes the file, rule, wave, and justification.

## Wave R2a (RUF)

- `src/schematika/electrical/__init__.py:140` — `# noqa: RUF022` — Wave R2a — Why: `__all__` is grouped by category (Core, Symbol factories, Constants, Utilities, Devices, PLC, Exceptions) for readability. Sorting alphabetically would destroy the intentional grouping that helps users find exports.

- `src/schematika/pcb/__init__.py:28` — `# noqa: RUF022` — Wave R2a — Why: `__all__` is grouped by sub-module (builder, errors, model) for readability. Sorting alphabetically would mix the logical sections.
