# Ratchet suppressions

Suppressions added during quality ratchet waves. Each entry includes the file, rule, wave, and justification.

## Wave R2a (RUF)

- `src/schematika/electrical/__init__.py:140` — `# noqa: RUF022` — Wave R2a — Why: `__all__` is grouped by category (Core, Symbol factories, Constants, Utilities, Devices, PLC, Exceptions) for readability. Sorting alphabetically would destroy the intentional grouping that helps users find exports.

- `src/schematika/pcb/__init__.py:28` — `# noqa: RUF022` — Wave R2a — Why: `__all__` is grouped by sub-module (builder, errors, model) for readability. Sorting alphabetically would mix the logical sections.

## Wave R5 (N-series naming)

- `tests/unit/test_pcb_adapter.py` — `[N806]` in per-file-ignores — Wave R5 — Why: tests use IEC fuse/terminal designators (F1, F2, F3, T1, _F1, _F2, _F3) as fixture identifiers; lowercasing would lose intent and misrepresent IEC naming conventions.

- `tests/unit/test_plc_resolver.py` — `[N806, N817]` in per-file-ignores — Wave R5 — Why: N806 covers `DI_MODULE_1CH` (PLC channel-count identifier, uppercase is conventional); N817 covers `PD`/`PMT`/`PR` import aliases for `PlcDesignation`/`PlcModuleType`/`PlcRack` (acronym aliases aid readability in dense PLC resolver tests).

- `tests/unit/test_terminal_type.py` — `[N817]` in per-file-ignores — Wave R5 — Why: `T` is the conventional single-letter alias for `Terminal` in IEC context test fixtures; renaming would reduce clarity.

## Wave R6 (BLE/RET/RSE/TRY)

- `TRY003` — globally ignored — Wave R6 — Why: Schematika already has a domain-exception hierarchy (CircuitValidationError, PIDError, PCBBuildError, with subclasses for specific failure modes — see `core/exceptions.py`, `pid/errors.py`, `pcb/errors.py`). TRY003's "every raise gets a custom subclass with the message hardcoded" rule would mean ~50+ new single-use subclasses for one-off validation messages. The architectural intent TRY003 nudges toward is already met by the base classes; per-message subclasses would be over-engineering.

- `src/schematika/mcp/server.py` — `[BLE001]` in per-file-ignores — Wave R6 — Why: `validate_circuit` and `render_circuit` are sandboxed user-code executors that intentionally convert any exception raised by arbitrary user Python into a structured error string. The broad `except Exception` is the correct narrowest catch for "anything user code can raise"; replacing it with narrower types would let errors escape the sandbox unformatted.

- `tests/unit/test_builder.py` — `[RET504]` in per-file-ignores — Wave R6 — Why: `mock_symbol` helper assigns the symbol to `s` before returning; fixing RET504 would require changing test fixture body logic, which is blocked per the wave R6 spec constraint on test bodies.
